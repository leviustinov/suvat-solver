This little simple tool is designed for Android 1.5. It solves SUVAT variables from 3 known variables.

This program uses the SUVAT class from my other project newt-mechanics (http://code.google.com/p/newt-mechanics/) with a little modification.

Please forgive the quality of code. This is my first Android application and second Java application...
